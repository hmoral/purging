## Methods
The model simulated an exome of 10,000 genes of 500 bp each with a recombination rate r=1e-4 (no recombination within genes), and a per base mutation rate m=5e-8. Deleterious selection coefficients (s) were taken from a gamma distribution (mean=-0.05 and shape=0.5) with a tail of 5% of lethal mutation and negative relationship between selection and dominance coefficients (h), following Kardos et al. (2022). We simulated an ancestral population at equilibrium (Ne=10,000) undergoing a severe decline (Ne=10 for 20 generations), followed by a recovery (Ne=2,000 for 20 generations). We calculated the total genetic load and its components, realized and masked load, following the formulas from Bertorelle et al. (2022).
